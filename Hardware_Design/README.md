# Hardware Specs

- NoiseAMP_BAT
> The battery pack for Noise Amplifier. Two 14500 Type 3.7V Li-ion Battery are used to provide ultralow power rail noise and high output current for NoiseAMP to work.

- NoiseAMP_V2.3(**Aborted**)
> The main PCB of the initial version of NoiseAMP, the current revision named EmoeNAP.

- EmoeNAP
> The current main PCB of NoiseAMP, called EmoeNAP, too.
  

To build a single cell EmoeNAPï¼Œ**just use EmoeNAP is enough**.  
To build a 2-cell EmoeNAP, maybe you could have a look at NoiseAMP_BAT.

> Using one cell is more convenient to charge the battery, but will degrade noise performance a little bit.  
> Using two cell would get the best noise performance of EmoeNAP.
